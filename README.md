The parser is heavily influenced by [this library written in scalla](https://github.com/vincasmiliunas/Quake-Live-Demo-Parser), however after after having issues building the project due to its age (uses old Java version etc) I decided to rewrite in C++ in something that is a little more stable.  It seems simpler and more productive to learn how it works and rewrite it rather than fighting with old libraries and maven.

The analytics on the parsed data will be done in Python using matplotlib
